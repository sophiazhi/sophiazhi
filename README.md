### Hi! ðŸŒ¸
I'm a junior at MIT studying Computer Science (6-3) and concentrating in Linguistics. My plans for this semester include
* Taking Software Studio (6.170) to experience full-stack development of larger-scale software.
* Taking Computational Cognitive Science (6.804/9.66) and Computational Psycholinguistics (9.19) to explore the computational representation of intelligence. These classes also introduce me to natural language processing -- the combination of my academic interests!
* Making CSS art, which is both a creative outlet and a way to increase my CSS proficiency.
