### Hi! ðŸŒ¸
I'm an M.Eng. student at MIT with a B.S. in Computer Science (6-3) and a minor in Linguistics. On my github you can find
* My contributions to TorchMultimodal and TorchVision
* Tools I developed to analyze an off-the-shelf model's predicted part-of-speech tags for CHILDES data
* Coursework from Software Studio (6.170)
* CSS art, both a creative outlet and a way to increase my CSS proficiency
* Projects from competitions and hackathons
