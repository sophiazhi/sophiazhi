### Hi! ðŸŒ¸
I'm a senior at MIT studying Computer Science (6-3) and minoring in Linguistics. On my github you can find
* Tools I developed to analyze an off-the-shelf model's predicted part-of-speech tags for CHILDES data.
* Coursework from Software Studio (6.170)
* CSS art, which is both a creative outlet and a way to increase my CSS proficiency
* Projects from competitions and hackathons
